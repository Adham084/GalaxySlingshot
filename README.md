# Galaxy Slingshot Obtainable
A [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/) mod for Stardew Valley 1.5.5 that makes the Galaxy Slingshot obtainable.

The Galaxy Slingshot is an unobtainable weapon in the game.

The only way to get it in this mod is from the adventurer's guild for only 25000g after getting the Galaxy Sword.

Contributions are welcome.
